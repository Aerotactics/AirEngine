AirEngine - Post Mortem
========================
When I started the semester, I decided to start my engine without any references besides past memory
and lecture content. It wasn't until Collisions that I actually opened up my GAP 275 project for
reference. I didn't copy anything from that project until then, and even then ended up rewriting the
collisions to use a process. That was my first mistake, since I know I probably could have used
more guidance from my past projects. Also from the beginning of the semester, I never planned to take 
this engine further than this semester, thinking I would simply restart and make a new engine next time. 
However, I've since changed my stance.

I made a game engine. It's not great, and it's not done, but it is a game engine. It has all the
components of a game engine. And on top of that, I also made PONG for the first time within this engine. 
I'm oddly proud of that achievement. I also see the potential to start making other games within this 
engine, but first I do want to rewrite each of the components. There's a lot to be desired, and I see 
where I made mistakes during the semester.

My engine is a foundation for what it will become. It's my new side project, and will eventually be my 
2D game engine of choice. Previously I used GameMaker Studio, which works, but has limited programming
functionality (though there's quite a bit there). But something as simple as a function has to be run
as a "script". At any rate, I see AirEngine being a usable 2D game engine with a little more work.

GAP 301
--------
I took this class online first, and maybe 30% of that information stuck afterwords. The online course is
written in a very textbook manner, and I found myself copying the code rather than learning what the code
actually does. However, this time around I made the game engine, from scratch, in 4 months, and I hand 
wrote about 95% of it, with help from you (Rez) and various other sources (GAP 275). And I understood it.

I also have a better understanding of the online content and why they made some of the choices they did.
I went into this class with the hope of understanding game engine architecture, and I feel I've achieved 
that. I also have a game engine that I could make other games on. Its not yet intuitive for a designer,
but with some more work it will get there.

LIKES - I thought the class was setup much better in the virtual class compared to the online class. It
forced me to make decisions and write the code myself basically. I feel I made some generally good 
decisions, but things can always be better. It felt like it was built on GAP 275 compared to the online
version, which felt quite a bit out of place.

DISLIKES - This goes mainly for the online version, but the difficulty seems to ramp up very suddenly
in the latter half. I know Angelo and Paul worked to-the-bone when they took the online class with me,
but I was lost half way in. I should have committed more time to the class (which I did this semester),
and this semester, I experienced similar difficulties, but overcame them.

There was a period of about 2 weeks where I was lost motivation to do anything. I don't have anything
to blame or any reason, but it set me back on all my work. I'm still trying to catch up.

Conclusion
-----------
This is being written on 5/14. I decided to try and do each final separately since I had 3 individual
projects after the midterm. I have about 2 weeks to do my Graphics final, but I'm hoping it takes less
time. I also have a wedding to attend on the 21-23. If I have more time, here's what I want to get done 
on the engine:

* World loads from XML (data-driven)
* Call CreateGameObject's from Lua (Lua)

And with that, I should meet the minimum requirements. I am close, but I may be out of time.

Update 5/15
------------
Had to do quite a bit of work to get the objects properly data driven. However, they actually load
from a lua file now. After seeing that work as well as it did, my mental state went from being "I'm
probably not passing" to "I'm probably not failing." While there is still that chance, I'm feeling
much more confident in my abilities, and my engine.

Though, the engine has bugs when an expected file is missing, so for now, don't remove any files.
It's still rough around the edges.

Update 5/16
------------
I gave myself until today to meet the minimum requirements, and although it's probably not what was
intended, it feels like an accomplishment. My game isn't entirely data driven, but it's better than
before. For instance: the game logic is in C++ objects. I'm not sure if that's the approach, or if
that kind of thing should be in Lua. When I asked "What should be in Lua?" the answer was a variation
of "It Depends," which I understand as "the Lua code should be the designer's code", but was a point 
of confusion for what should and shouldn't be in the C++ game logic.

Final Conclusion
-----------------
The engine works as an engine. It's rough around the edges and has bugs when files are unexpectedly
missing, but those can be fixed over time. I think It'll be ok, but if not, that just means more time
to work on this engine next semester.
